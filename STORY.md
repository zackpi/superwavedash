Super Melee Maker

Backstory

I always wanted to make something for the melee community
I've also always thought that melee's mechanics are really good, but the story was lacking
There was an opportunity to take the movement mechanics and make levels and a story that really shine
I observed the level design in Super Mario Maker (1 & 2), from the shittiest hot garbage to very creative, good levels.
The community there creates a wealth of great levels, and I think it can be adapted for melee as well.

At the same time, I think documenting the process of getting started will help other modders as they first start dipping their toes into modding.
The tools available when I first started trying to mod were very poor, and the documentation was spread out across several forums and forum posts.
So I had trouble building anything, and by the time I actually did make some progress I was so burnt out and discouraged that I ended up forgetting about those projects.
Software development on Windows is also a bit of a pain in the ass, and unfortunately that seems to be the weapon of choice for most of the community.
Fortunately I have a Mac laptop in addition to a tower dual-booting Windows and Fedora, so I really have most of the bases covered if I need to switch platforms to get something done.

Vision (Player Side)

You get all comfy in front of your PC to play some Super Melee Maker, and you're in an adventurous mood.
You open up Dolphin and click on the Super Melee Maker ISO.
The game boots into the Event Match screen, but something looks a little different...
One of the events is called "World 1-1 any%", and the selected character is Mario.
The description says "race to the finish :)))" and the high score is 0:23.068.
There are several more events, and they continue to appear as you scroll down.
They were loaded from the community archive, so they were actually created and submitted through SMM!

You select the "World 1-1 any%" and a custom stage loads, and Mario appears too.
You jump and wavedash until you reach the end of the level, where you see your time is 0:22.385. New Record!
You give the level a heart and then return to the Event Match screen to play another level.

Now, you decide that you want to search for levels made by your friends and try those out.
You go to superwavedash.com and search your friends' usernames to find the levels that they created.
You click on one of the levels, and it has the title "Samus Kaizo" and a description "no one will be able to beat this"
Well now you have to try to beat it! You click on "Play" and the stage boots up in your Dolphin instance.
You play the level and die tons of times, but you eventually beat it.
You see the high score on superwavedash.com change to your username and the time 1:48.768.
You leave a comment "Ha! no match for me >:)"

Vision (Creator Side)

You played a few Super Melee Maker levels in the past, and you have a clever idea for a new level.
You want to make a puzzle level, where you have to use Kirby's copy abilities to execute some specific tasks to get to the end.
You visit superwavedash.com where Super Melee Maker loads up.
You can drag and drop platforms in a 3d space, and change the starting character too.
You place down items and enemies to build your puzzle just the way you want it.
As you go, you click the "Play-Test" button to launch the level inside of your Super Melee Maker ISO.
When you are satisfied with the level, you click the "Publish" button to submit the level to the community database.
Later, you check back on your level in the superwavedash.com dashboard, and tons of people have hearted the level.
